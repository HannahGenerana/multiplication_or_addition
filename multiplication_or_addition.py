# Exercise 1: Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers
# Given two integer numbers, return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than 1000. Otherwise, return their sum.

# pseudocode

# create a function checking whether the value is less tha or greater than 1000

# multiply the two integer

# add the two integer

# print the product if less than or equal to 1000

# print the sum if greater than 1000
